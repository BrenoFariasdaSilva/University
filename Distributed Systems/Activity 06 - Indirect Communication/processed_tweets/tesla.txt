Text: @Teslarati @13ericralph31 Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be &lt;2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter.

Username: elonmusk 
Text: @nextspaceflight @chraveesh @Teslarati No, they‚Äôre SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time.

Username: elonmusk 
Text: @chraveesh @Teslarati Yes, we‚Äôre tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area

Username: elonmusk 
Text: @Teslarati That said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it‚Äôs built inside a factory in volume.

Username: elonmusk 
Text: @Teslarati This isn‚Äôt quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that‚Äôs 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.
